# hunt-the-wumpus
Hunt the Wumpus is a text-based adventure game developed by Gregory Yob in 1973. The original game was written BASIC was a big hit in the late 70’s. This version is my Python reinterpretation of the classic Basic Game. In this game, the player navigates through a series of connected caves arranged in the shape of a dodecahedron as they hunt the dreaded Wumpus.

Unlike the classic version, this game uses dictionaries, lists, and recursive programming to simulate the same feel as the original. I wanted to avoid using object-oriented programming for this version and stay with multiple functions. Based on Gregory Yob’s version, the original version had several gosubs in the code. To mimic that, I used functions and recursive calls.

The turn-based game continues until you kill the Wumpus, get killed yourself, or quit. The game is a classic, and I remember when it came out to the gaming community in the seventies, and it’s still fun to play even today.
